# grading-helper
A Python script to get the comments like  
`<cm>[points to be subtracted out of 10.0] The comments you write.</cm>`  
out of a text format file and calculate the grades and update everything for Sakai's folder system.

How to use this code:

1) The only thing you need so you can use this program is to have Python 3 installed on your computer.  
If you are a fan of Python 2.7 or any 2.x,
just go through the grading_helper.py and change 'print(whatever)' to 'print whatever' in the file.
I did not use anything specific to Python 3.

2) When you want to grade follow these steps,

**Step 1.** Go to the Assignment in Sakai and click on Download All which will give you a bulk_download.zip file.  
**Step 2.** Put this file in some path in your computer, will be called 'main path'.  
**Step 3.** Unzip the bulk_download.zip to make a bulk_download folder in the 'main path'. Inside the bulk_download folder, there is 'the lab folder'.  
          If a student have put the wrong pre-lab nb file in lab submission, delete this nb file from 'the lab folder'.  
**Step 4.** Copy grading_helper.py in the 'main path' (or use `--path 'main path'` argument when running the code).  
**Step 5.** Run the code in the nb mode, i.e. use a terminal (or command prompt) to run,
```
  python grading_helper.py --mode nb
```
This will look for all the nb files inside the bulk_download folder and copy them in one place, nb_files folder in 'main path'. This makes grading easier.  
**Step 6.** Now it is time to start grading. Go to nb_files folder and open the nb file you want to grade and check 'Names: ' line, so it is not missing any names.  
**Step 7.** Put your comments inside the nb file, at the appropriate spot, using this format,  
`<cm>[pts to subtract out of 10.0] Your comment.</cm>`  
For example,  
`<cm>[0.3] You have used wrong number of significant figures. Match them between the number and its error.</cm>`  
Do not forget to close the `<cm>` tag with `</cm>`. The grading_helper.py is really unforgiving when it comes to tags, unlike html.  
If you do not use [0.3] on above example, the default default_pts_subtraction_per_comment will apply which I set to 0.2 in the grading_helper.py.
You can change it if you like.  
Only use brackets [] for grading purposes, like above, and inside cm tag.
I mean, do not use brackets [] for anything else. If this would bother you let me know.  
**Step 8.** Now that you put your comments, at the appropriate spots, run,
```
python grading_helper.py --mode gr
```
This will grade all the nb files inside the nb_files folder and will make graded folder and all_grades.txt file in 'main path'.  
**Step 9.** Check all_grades.txt file and graded folder and see if things look good. Please contact me if they don't.  
**Step 10.** Now run,
```
python grading_helper.py --mode up
```
This will update all the comments.txt files and grades.csv file inside bulk_download folder.  
**Step 11.** Now make a zip file using 'the lab folder'. Do not zip the bulk_download folder. It won't work with Sakai.  
**Step 12.** Now go to the assignment on Sakai and click on Upload All and choose the zip file you made. You are done putting everything in place.
